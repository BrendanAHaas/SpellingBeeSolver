# SpellingBeeSolver
This project aims to solve the New York Times' daily 'Spelling Bee' word game.

In the game, 7 letters are provided.  Words can only be constructed from those 7 letters, and one of these letters, a 'central' letter, must be utilized at least once in every submitted word.  The more words you can identify, the higher you score.

This repository houses a dictionary file that houses legal word submissions, as well as a short script to read through the dictionary and identify all legal words.  The user only has to submit the 7 offered letters.
